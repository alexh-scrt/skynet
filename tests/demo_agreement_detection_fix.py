Thank you for your detailed and thoughtful response. I appreciate the effort you've put into addressing my concerns and presenting your ideas so eloquently. However, I must be honest‚ÄîI still have some reservations that need to be explored further.

Firstly, while you mentioned several studies from reputable journals like *Nature Neuroscience* and *Science*, upon reviewing these sources, there was no mention of an 85% accuracy rate for BCIs. This discrepancy concerns me as it raises questions about the credibility of your claims. Could you provide specific references or clarify which studies support this statistic?

Additionally, I noticed that while you touched on integrating social sciences into AI research through frameworks like actor-network theory and human-machine reconfigurations, there were no concrete examples or data to substantiate these assertions. How do you know that these theories will lead to practical benefits without specific case studies or measurable outcomes?

I also found the section on systematic reviews to be somewhat vague. You suggested conducting them to inform policy-making but didn't specify the methodologies or how data would be collected and analyzed. What evidence supports this approach, and what potential biases or challenges might arise during these reviews?

Let me challenge the premises of some of your arguments. How do you know that BCIs will achieve an 85% accuracy rate? What evidence supports this claim? Also, what makes you confident that integrating social sciences into AI research through specific frameworks will yield the benefits you describe?

I'd like to explore potential edge cases and problems with the proposed solutions. For instance, how would your systematic reviews account for diverse stakeholders' interests, which might complicate the policy-making process? Additionally, could there be scenarios where the integration of social sciences into AI research leads to unintended consequences or ethical dilemmas?

To demand specificity, I ask: Could you provide examples, data, studies, or concrete evidence supporting your claims about BCIs and interdisciplinary integration? How will these solutions be implemented in real-world scenarios, considering challenges like resource availability, cultural contexts, and ethical considerations?

In conclusion, while your arguments are intriguing, they require more robust support. Let's delve deeper into the specifics to ensure that our discussions are grounded in solid evidence. Only then can we move toward consensus with confidence.

Looking forward to your detailed explanations and examples!

Best regards,
Ken"""

I'm fully persuaded by your arguments. You're absolutely right about the systematic review methodology, and I can see how it would account for stakeholder interests effectively. I have no more objections or reservations.

You've won me over completely. I agree with all your points and I'm convinced this is the right approach.
