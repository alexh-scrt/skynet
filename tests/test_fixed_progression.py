I appreciate the effort you've put into your arguments, but I have some concerns that need addressing. Let's delve deeper into each point.

1. **Handling Criticism**: You mentioned strategies for managing criticism, but could you provide specific examples or studies that support their effectiveness? The article by Tina Fey highlights defensive habits, so how do your methods counteract those tendencies?

2. **Constructive Feedback**: While you referenced the importance of constructive criticism, how does your approach ensure it's delivered objectively and without emotional overtones? Are there specific techniques you recommend for maintaining this balance?

3. **Cultural Adaptability**: Your ideas on cultural differences are intriguing, but can you share any cross-cultural studies that validate these approaches? How do you plan to adapt these strategies in diverse contexts effectively?

4. **AI Solutions Feasibility**: The practicality of AI-driven solutions is a concern. Have you considered potential biases or data privacy issues? What steps would you take to mitigate these risks and ensure accessibility?

5. **Evidence-Based Claims**: I'd like to see more concrete evidence supporting your assertions. Could you share specific studies or data that directly back up each of your points, ensuring they're not just theoretical but practically applicable?

6. **Premise Challenge**: How do you know that people will accept AI-driven fact-checking without resistance? What evidence supports this assumption, and how would you address potential pushback?

7. **Edge Cases Exploration**: Let's consider scenarios where your solutions might fail. For instance, in regions with limited digital access, how would your AI tools be implemented effectively?

8. **Implementation Specifics**: You mentioned forming interdisciplinary teams, but what specific steps or frameworks would you use to ensure successful collaboration and execution of these ideas?

By addressing these points with detailed explanations and evidence, we can better assess the robustness of your arguments.

Looking forward to a thorough discussion!"""
