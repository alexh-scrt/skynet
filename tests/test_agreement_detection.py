Thank you for your detailed and thoughtful response. I appreciate the effort you've put into addressing my concerns and presenting your ideas so eloquently. However, I must be honest‚ÄîI still have some reservations that need to be explored further.

Firstly, while you mentioned several studies from reputable journals like *Nature Neuroscience* and *Science*, upon reviewing these sources, there was no mention of an 85% accuracy rate for BCIs. This discrepancy concerns me as it raises questions about the credibility of your claims. Could you provide specific references or clarify which studies support this statistic?

Additionally, I noticed that while you touched on integrating social sciences into AI research through frameworks like actor-network theory and human-machine reconfigurations, there were no concrete examples or data to substantiate these assertions. How do you know that these theories will lead to practical benefits without specific case studies or measurable outcomes?

Let me challenge the premises of some of your arguments. How do you know that BCIs will achieve an 85% accuracy rate? What evidence supports this claim? Also, what makes you confident that integrating social sciences into AI research through specific frameworks will yield the benefits you describe?

Looking forward to your detailed explanations and examples!

Best regards,
Ken"""
